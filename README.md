## About the project 

A chrome extension to bring all your social media handles under one hood. Just save your profiles once and access them whenever needed.

This is a browser extension which uses browser's local storage to store all the links to your social profiles in the form of a JavaScript object. 

User can click on any icon to copy the link to the respective profile to their clipboard making it feasible for them to fill forms without having to search for each link separately.

## User Interface

## How to get the code running

### To visualise the browser extension, follow the following steps (Please note - since there isn't any code in manifest file, this wouldn't work as of now, you can use normal chrome to visualise the design changes) - 

 * Clone/Download this repository or fork it, as applies

 * Open chrome

 * In the address bar, type 'chrome://extensions'.

 * Enable 'Developer Mode' from the topmost-left corner (if not already provided).

 * Select 'Load Unpacked' option from the top.

 * Browse the location of the saved project and double-click the folder containing all the files.

 * You're good to go now. You'll be able to locate the extension in the extensions' section.

### Requirements

 * Browser (Google Chrome prefered)
 * Text Editor (VS Code required). Install 'Live SASS compiler' extension to work with SCSS.
